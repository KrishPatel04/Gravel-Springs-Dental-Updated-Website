    <h3>
      Doctor of Dental Surgery; Founder Gravel Springs Dental; Former Phlebotomy Technician
    </h3>

    <div class="staffBackground">
      <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt the beginning of his journey to becoming a respected member of the dental community,
        Dr. Patel worked as a Phlebotomy Technician. During this time, he developed his skills in patient care and
        attention to detail, which proved invaluable in his future career as a dentist.

        <br>
        <br>

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter realizing his passion for helping patients achieve healthy and beautiful smiles,
        Dr. Patel pursued a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Virginia Commonwealth University. He honed his skills
        in
        patient care and attention to detail, becoming a skilled dentist. Dr. Patel has since become a respected member
        of
        prestigious organizations, such as the American Dental Association, Georgia Dental Association, and Northern
        District Dental Society.

        <br>
        <br>

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDr. Patel's extensive education and professional affiliations make him a trustworthy
        professional in the dental community. Patients can trust that they are in good hands with Dr. Patel.

        <br>
        <br>

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs a fun fact, Dr. Patel's favorite tooth is the molar, or as he affectionately calls
        it,
        "the workhorse of the mouth." He often jokes that he loves molars so much that he dreams about them at night!

        <br>
        <br>

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut in all seriousness, Dr. Patel is dedicated to providing his patients with the best
        dental care possible. He believes that a healthy, beautiful smile can improve overall health and boost
        confidence.
        So don't be afraid to visit Dr. Patel and let him work his magic on your pearly whites. He promises not to bore
        you with too many tooth puns (unless you ask for them, of course!).
